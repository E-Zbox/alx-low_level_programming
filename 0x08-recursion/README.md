### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General

-   What is recursion
-   How to implement recursion
-   In what situations you should implement recursion
-   In what situations you shouldn‚Äôt implement recursion

### Tasks

## 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

_File: `0-puts_recursion.c`_

-   Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `puts`. Run `man puts` to learn more.

## 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

_File: `5-sqrt_recursion.c`_

-   Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`
-   If `n` does not have a natural square root, the function should return ` -1`

FYI: The standard library provides a different function: `sqrt`. Run `man sqrt` to learn more.

## 6. Inception. Is it possible?

Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

_File: `6-is_prime_number.c`_

-   Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n)`
